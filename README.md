LIMIT 10;

-- 3. Alumni Who Applied and Got Hired
SELECT a.full_name, jp.job_title, e.company_name
FROM job_application ja
JOIN job_posting jp ON ja.job_posting_id = jp.job_posting_id
JOIN employer e ON jp.employer_id = e.employer_id
JOIN employment_history eh ON ja.alumni_id = eh.alumni_id AND eh.employer_id = e.employer_id
JOIN alumni a ON a.alumni_id = ja.alumni_id
